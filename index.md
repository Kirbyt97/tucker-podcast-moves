#A Very Detailed Podcast Review

##My Podcast: *Serial*

###Why I Picked It

I picked *Serial* because of its investigative journalism approach. At first I did not realize that this show was nonfiction. I suspect this was because of how interesing the host, Sarah Koenig, made the content and the fantistic delivery of the story.

What I did not know when listening to the first episode, assigned for class, was that at the time *Serial* was the most popular podcast of all time. I think this podcast was so successful due mostly to Koenig's delivery. She made this real-life event come to life in a way the murder mystery novels strive to do.

*Serial* can be found [here](https://serialpodcast.org/season-one) if you wish to listen to it as well.

##Organization

I listened to four episodes of Season 1 of *Serial*. Most episodes are formatted the exact same way. Koenig typically structures her podcasts like the following:
1. Introduction to the days topic (Exposition) 
1. Some episodes include police recordings (Episode 4) or interviews to introduce the topic before Koenig speaks
1.  Koenig will then make a point about Adnan Syed's case
1. There will then be evidence to support that point. This evidence can take the form of: interviews, police recording, evidence, and even diary readings 
1. Next, Koenig will typically include a counterpoint to refute the previous topic- wether it be in Adnan's favor or not. The same evidence will be included
1. Often times Koenig will insert her own opinion after the point-counterpoint approach. 
1. To conclude the episode there are often cliffhangers alluding to the next episodes topic
