#A Very Detailed Podcast Review

##My Podcast: *Serial*

###Why I Picked It

I picked *Serial* because of its investigative journalism approach. At first I did not realize that this show was nonfiction. I suspect this was because of how interesing the host, Sarah Koenig, made the content and the fantistic delivery of the story.

What I did not know when listening to the first episode, assigned for class, was that at the time *Serial* was the most popular podcast of all time. I think this podcast was so successful due mostly to Koenig's delivery. She made this real-life event come to life in a way the murder mystery novels strive to do.

*Serial* can be found [here](https://serialpodcast.org/season-one) if you wish to listen to it as well.

##Organization

I listened to four episodes of Season 1 of *Serial*. Most episodes are formatted the exact same way. Koenig typically structures her podcasts like the following:
1. Introduction to the days topic (Exposition) 
1. Some episodes include police recordings (Episode 4) or interviews to introduce the topic before Koenig speaks
1.  Koenig will then make a point about Adnan Syed's case
1. There will then be evidence to support that point. This evidence can take the form of: interviews, police recording, evidence, and even diary readings 
1. Next, Koenig will typically include a counterpoint to refute the previous topic- wether it be in Adnan's favor or not. The same evidence will be included
1. Often times Koenig will insert her own opinion after the point-counterpoint approach. 
1. To conclude the episode there are often cliffhangers alluding to the next episodes topic

In my opinion, Koenig's approach is very sucessful. By providing a point followed by a counterpoint the audience is allowed to formulate their own conclusion. I did notice, however, that some of Koenig's tactics are those usually reserved for fiction. She makes frequent use of cliffhangers and often interjects her own opinion. By interjecting her own opinions of the case, I am unsure as to what degree the audience is meant to formulate their own opinion. It is clear, for the most part, that Koenig belives Adnan is innocent. Despite providing points that may show Adnan in a bad light, it is clear that the audience is meant to feel sympath for this possibly wrongfully accused man.

On the other hand, by incorporating tactics not typical of journalism, Koenig is able to envelope the audience in the story. By using cliffhangers the audience is left wanting more. And by including a point-counterpoint approach the audience is given the chance to come up with their own opinion about Adnan.
