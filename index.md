#A Very Detailed Podcast Review

##My Podcast: *Serial*

###Why I Picked It

I picked *Serial* because of its investigative journalism approach. At first I did not realize that this show was nonfiction. I suspect this was because of how interesting the host, Sarah Koenig, made the content and the fantastic delivery of the story.


What I did not know when listening to the first episode, assigned for class, was that at the time *Serial* was the most popular podcast of all time. I think this podcast was so successful due mostly to Koenig's delivery. She made this real-life event come to life in a way the murder mystery novels strive to do.

*Serial* can be found [here](https://serialpodcast.org/season-one) if you wish to listen to it as well.

##Organization

### Typical Episode Setup

I listened to four episodes of Season 1 of *Serial*. Most episodes are formatted the exact same way. Koenig typically structures her podcasts like the following:
1. Introduction to the days topic (Exposition) 
1. Some episodes include police recordings (Episode 4) or interviews to introduce the topic before Koenig speaks
1.  Koenig will then make a point about Adnan Syed's case
1. There will then be evidence to support that point. This evidence can take the form of: interviews, police recording, evidence, and even diary readings 
1. Next, Koenig will typically include a counterpoint to refute the previous topic- whether it be in Adnan's favor or not. The same evidence will be included
1. Often Koenig will insert her own opinion after the point-counterpoint approach. 
1. To conclude the episode there are often cliffhangers alluding to the next episode's topic

### My Opinion of the Structure 

In my opinion, Koenig's approach is very successful. By providing a point followed by a counterpoint the audience is allowed to formulate their own conclusion. I did notice, however, that some of Koenig's tactics are those usually reserved for fiction. She makes frequent use of cliffhangers and often interjects her own opinion. By interjecting her own opinions of the case, I am unsure as to what degree the audience is meant to formulate their own opinion. It is clear, for the most part, that Koenig believes Adnan is innocent. Despite providing points that may show Adnan in a bad light, it is clear that the audience is meant to feel sympathy for this possibly wrongfully accused man.

On the other hand, by incorporating tactics not typical of journalism, Koenig is able to envelope the audience in the story. By using cliffhangers the audience is left wanting more. And by including a point-counterpoint approach the audience is given the chance to come up with their own opinion about Adnan. 

This show also seems to resemble real-life police drama shows seen on the television. Those shows, 30-Minutes for example, are hugely successful and have been airing for years. Koenig seems to take many cues from those shows which aids in how successful this podcast became. Some of these similarities are the use of cliffhangers, hunches, usage of evidence, and interviews with the actual convict. These are just a few of the reasons why *Serial* kept listeners coming back for more, making it the most successful podcast at the time.

## Style

### Sound FX

I did not notice much, if any, use of this effect in *Serial*. If FX was used it was used very sparingly. Due to the serious nature of the show FX may not have been the most appropriate addition. As a result, most of the artificial  sounds in *Serial* came from music opposed to effects.

### Music

*Serial* makes infrequent, but effective usage of music. Some of the ways music is used in this podcast are:
* A theme song is played at the beginning of each episode
* Music is played to emphasize major points
* When Koenig wants the audience to ponder a confusing point music is often played
* In Episode 3 when Koenig is discussing prom, the music mentioned in Hae Min Lee's diary is played
* The theme song is repeated at the end of each episode 

Music is used infrequently in this series. It is often reserved only for major plot points. Music is also used when it is clearly relevant, such as when a particular song was mentioned is it played in the background.

The theme song played reflects the mood of the series outstandingly. This song is played at the beginning and end of each episode and is also used sometimes when there is an important point. The song is slightly eerie, but also portrays a sense of inquisitiveness. This inquisitive sound reflects Koenig's own curiosity in this murder case. Sound does a great deal to affect the human mood and by playing this song at the beginning of each episode the listener is always in the proper mindset to hear what comes next.

## Narrative Conventions

### Use of the Interview

*Serial* relies heavily on interviews. Koenig personally interviewed most major witnesses and suspects of Hae Min Lee's murder. Just a few of the people interviewed up unto Episode 4 include:
* Adnan Syed- convicted of Lee's murder
* Adnan's mother
* Friends of Adnan
* Asia- could provide alibi for Adnan, never interviewed
* Jenn- claims that she saw both Jay and Adnan on the night of the murder

These interviews are conducted both in person, and on the phone. Koenig travels to some witnesse's homes to conduct the interview. Other times Koenig is denied interviews that could have been very interesting. 

By interviewing those directly related to the case Koenig builds credibility and rapport with her listeners. This gives the audience the chance to hear a firsthand account of what those personally involved in the murder feel. 

Some of those interviewed feel as though Adnan is innocent, while others feel as those he is guilty. However, one commonality is that both sides seem to agree that the circumstances surrounding Adnan's involvement with the murder seem suspicious. These interviews serve to reflect how many feel divided over Adnan's innocence which has led to his many appeals for freedom. 

### Archival Material

There is frequent use of archived material in this series. Since this is investigative journalism the use of evidence is extremely important and appropriate. Some types of archived materials used are:
* Police interrogations
* Lee's diary
* Evidence used in court

Police interrogations and court evidence are extremely important in *Serial*. They are relied heavily throughout the series, but particularly in Episodes 3 and 4. Episode 4 is almost entirely police recordings of another possible suspect besides Adnan. These official interviews and interrogations give listeners context in the case and allow them to understand where the prosecution was coming from. 

### Narration

There is much narration in *Serial*. For most of the episodes I listened to the beginning is purely Koenig's narration of the shows topic. She uses this tool to inform the listeners of what they are about to hear and some important things to look out for.

Narration is also used when Koenig interjects her own opinion or clarifies things. She often lets the listeners know what she is thinking and places emphasis on these things. She will also use narration to clarify what the evidence or interviews were talking about. These bits of narration are important in helping the listener understand what is going on and stay on top of the story.

### Who does the Talking?

Most of the talking is done by the host, Sarah Koenig. Her speaking is combined with frequent inserts of interviews and police evidence. So, despite Koenig consistently doing most of the speaking, there are many other people the listener gets to hear from. 

### Is it Scripted?

I would say there is a combination of scripted and non-scripted elements in this podcasts. The narrated bits of this podcast are scripted, while the interviews are not. 

Even though I would not consider the interviews scripted, Koenig most likely has a set list of questions or prompts she wants to cover with her guests. Having this list of topics helps keep the conversation on track and give her usable footage for the podcast, but it is not scripted per say.
