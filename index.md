#A Very Detailed Podcast Review

##My Podcast: *Serial*

###Why I Picked It

I picked *Serial* because of its investigative journalism approach. At first I did not realize that this show was nonfiction. I suspect this was because of how interesting the host, Sarah Koenig, made the content and the fantastic delivery of the story.


What I did not know when listening to the first episode, assigned for class, was that at the time *Serial* was the most popular podcast of all time. I think this podcast was so successful due mostly to Koenig's delivery. She made this real-life event come to life in a way the murder mystery novels strive to do.

*Serial* can be found [here](https://serialpodcast.org/season-one) if you wish to listen to it as well.

##Organization

### Typical Episode Setup

I listened to four episodes of Season 1 of *Serial*. Most episodes are formatted the exact same way. Koenig typically structures her podcasts like the following:
1. Introduction to the days topic (Exposition) 
1. Some episodes include police recordings (Episode 4) or interviews to introduce the topic before Koenig speaks
1.  Koenig will then make a point about Adnan Syed's case
1. There will then be evidence to support that point. This evidence can take the form of: interviews, police recording, evidence, and even diary readings 
1. Next, Koenig will typically include a counterpoint to refute the previous topic- whether it be in Adnan's favor or not. The same evidence will be included
1. Often Koenig will insert her own opinion after the point-counterpoint approach. 
1. To conclude the episode there are often cliffhangers alluding to the next episode's topic

### My Opinion of the Structure 

In my opinion, Koenig's approach is very successful. By providing a point followed by a counterpoint the audience is allowed to formulate their own conclusion. I did notice, however, that some of Koenig's tactics are those usually reserved for fiction. She makes frequent use of cliffhangers and often interjects her own opinion. By interjecting her own opinions of the case, I am unsure as to what degree the audience is meant to formulate their own opinion. It is clear, for the most part, that Koenig believes Adnan is innocent. Despite providing points that may show Adnan in a bad light, it is clear that the audience is meant to feel sympathy for this possibly wrongfully accused man.

On the other hand, by incorporating tactics not typical of journalism, Koenig is able to envelope the audience in the story. By using cliffhangers the audience is left wanting more. And by including a point-counterpoint approach the audience is given the chance to come up with their own opinion about Adnan. 

This show also seems to resemble real-life police drama shows seen on the television. Those shows, 30-Minutes for example, are hugely successful and have been airing for years. Koenig seems to take many cues from those shows which aids in how successful this podcast became. Some of these similarities are the use of cliffhangers, hunches, usage of evidence, and interviews with the actual convict. These are just a few of the reasons why *Serial* kept listeners coming back for more, making it the most successful podcast at the time.

## Style

### Sound FX

I did not notice much, if any, use of this effect in *Serial*. If FX was used it was used very sparingly. Due to the serious nature of the show FX may not have been the most appropriate addition. As a result most of the artifical sounds in *Serial* came from music opposed to effects.

### Music

*Serial* makes infrequent, but effective usage of music. Some of the ways music is used in this podcast are:
* A theme song is played at the beginning of each episode
* Music is played to emphasize major points
* When Koening wants the audience to ponder a confusing point music is often played
* In Episode 3 when Koenig is discussing prom, the music mentioned in Hae Min Lee's diary is played
* The theme song is repeated at the end of each episode 

Music is used infrequently in this series. It is often reserved only for major plot points. Music is also used when it is clearly relevant, such as when a particular song was mentioned is it played in the background.

The theme song played reflects the mood of the series outstandingly. This song is played at the beginning and end of each episode and is also used sometimes when there is an important point. The song is slightly eerie, but also portrays a sense of inquesintiveness. This inquistive sound reflects Koening's own couriousity in this murder case. Sound does a great deal to affect the human mood and by playing this song at the beginning of each episode the listener is always in the proper mindset to hear what comes next.
